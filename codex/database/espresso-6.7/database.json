The rotated dvscf will then be stored in directory dvscf_star%dir with name prefix.dvscf_star%ext.q_name//\"1\". Where q_name is derived from the coordinates of the q-point, expressed as fractions in crystalline coordinates (notice that ph.x reads q-points in cartesian coordinates). E.g. q_cryst= (0, 0.5, -0.25) -> q_name = \"0_1o2_-1o4\"  The dvscf can be represented on a basis of cartesian 1-atom displacements (dvscf_star%basis='cartesian') or on the basis of the modes at the rotated q-point (dvscf_star%basis='modes'). Notice that the el-ph wannier code requires 'cartesian'. Each dvscf file comes with a corresponding pattern file with an additional \".pat\" suffix; this file contains information about the basis and the q-point of the dvscf.  Note: rotating dvscf can require a large amount of RAM memory and can be i/o       intensive; in its current implementation all the operations are done       on a single processor. Note2: this feature is currently untested with image parallelisation."

In the scalar relativistic case: S -> l=0, m=0 P -> l=1, z, x, y D -> l=2, r^2-3z^2, xz, yz, xy, x^2-y^2  In the noncollinear magnetic case (with or without spin-orbit), each group of states is doubled. For instance: P -> l=1, z, x, y for spin up, l=1, z, x, y for spin down. Up and down is relative to the direction of the starting magnetization.  In the case with spin-orbit and time-reversal (starting_magnetization=0.0) the atomic wavefunctions are radial functions multiplied by spin-angle functions. For instance: P -> l=1, j=1/2, m_j=-1/2,1/2. l=1, j=3/2,      m_j=-3/2, -1/2, 1/2, 3/2.  In the magnetic case with spin-orbit the atomic wavefunctions can be forced to be spin-angle functions by setting starting_spin_angle to .TRUE.."
