The rotated dvscf will then be stored in directory dvscf_star%dir with name prefix.dvscf_star%ext.q_name//\"1\". Where q_name is derived from the coordinates of the q-point, expressed as fractions in crystalline coordinates (notice that ph.x reads q-points in cartesian coordinates). E.g. q_cryst= (0, 0.5, -0.25) -> q_name = \"0_1o2_-1o4\"  The dvscf can be represented on a basis of cartesian 1-atom displacements (dvscf_star%basis='cartesian') or on the basis of the modes at the rotated q-point (dvscf_star%basis='modes'). Notice that the el-ph wannier code requires 'cartesian'. Each dvscf file comes with a corresponding pattern file with an additional \".pat\" suffix; this file contains information about the basis and the q-point of the dvscf.  Note: rotating dvscf can require a large amount of RAM memory and can be i/o       intensive; in its current implementation all the operations are done       on a single processor.

A reasonable estimate for a      layer's thickness could be the interlayer distance in the      corresponding layered bulk material. Otherwise,      the atomic thickness + 10 bohr should be a safe estimate.      There is also a lower limit of 20 bohr imposed by the cutoff      radius used to read pseudopotentials (see read_pseudo.f90 in Modules).     - As for ESM above, only in-plane stresses make sense and one      should use cell_dofree= '2Dxy' in a vc-relax calculation."
